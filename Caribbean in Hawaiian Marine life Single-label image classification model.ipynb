    "### Project Overview\n",
    "As an avid snorkeler and someone who has always been interested in the unique Marine reef life ecosystem that exists within the water, I have taken many trips to explore reefs in the ocean and taken enormous amounts of images underwater. Still, I am always at a loss for what I am taking an image of; some marine life creatures I know quite well, including a green sea turtle, but others I am at a complete loss in identifying. The image classification model will create a system in which I can upload distinct sea creatures, and the model can properly identify and allow me to know what exactly I am looking at without needing a guide key to identify different underwater animals and fish that exist. The image classification model is simply a way to speed up my comprehension of the underwater creatures and ecosystems I have explored and identify what the sea creatures are when snorkeling in the ocean with my GoPro when taking enormous amounts of pictures and videos.\n",
